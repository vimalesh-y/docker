# Experimenting with Docker

In this exercise, I create a Docker image from a Linux environment with Python. I run the image and a container is started, before I use VIM to create a file within the image and save it. The image is finally stopped.

## Requirements

- Tested on Python version 3.12.6, which also pulled in pip (version 24.2)
